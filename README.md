# Monthly_Complaint_Analysis
Quality Engineering tool. 

Pulls complaint data from a .csv file and analyzes it. The columns in the data sheet and the anticipated column names in the code need to match for the following: product family, product, individual product catalog numbers, complaint event descriptions, lot numbers (company and supplier), FDA Trending Device Code, date recorded, facility reporting the event. 

This program needs to be in the same directory as the data sheet file. The title of the data sheet file must match the anticipated data sheet file name in the code. 

A new folder will be made. Multiple folders in the new folder will contain new excel files with tables of the data and graphs.

There are preset filters for important spikes in complaints. These need to be modified to suit the user's needs.
